## Pre-review checklist

These should be followed unless you're dealing with an emergency. In an emergency, use your best judgment. 

- [ ] I've tested the code as an end user would and included appropriate testing steps 
- [ ] For all new functionality, I have added thorough, applicable tests that validate my changes
- [ ] For improvements to existing functionality, I've followed the [campsite rule](https://github.com/encodium/.github-private/blob/main/profile/pages/dev-standards.md#git), leaving it a little better than I found it. 
- [ ] The added feature contains necessary observability
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation
- [ ] Request a review from a [merger](https://github.com/encodium/.github-private/blob/main/profile/pages/dev-standards.md#git) (list available [here](https://github.com/orgs/encodium/teams/mergers))

## Reviewer checklist
